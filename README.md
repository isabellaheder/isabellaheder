Hi! My name is [**Isabella Heder**](www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-heder-b7b022296). I am a Data Science student at FIAP with a strong interest in technology.

During my studies, I have gained practical experience with essential tools such as Python, Power BI, Microsoft Office, SQL, Docker and many others. 

I am a very dedicated person and I am always looking for experiences to learn and evolve professionally. My profile is characterized by responsibility, excellent communication and group work skills.

Currently, my goal is to get my first internship at a renowned company that makes use of data technology, where I can put my knowledge into practice and continue to evolve professionally.

You can see some of my projects here! Hope you enjoy :)
